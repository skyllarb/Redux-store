# Redux-store


## Description:

- Why refactor the code to se Redux?

    A Redux store is independent of any UI, and so it can be used separate from React. The React DevTools allow viewing the current context value, but not any of the historical values or changes over time.

- What was the problem solved?

    The problem was implementing Redux, it is new for me to learn. Fully understanding global state, actions, and reducers was a little confusing initially but after reading enough I foud the resolution.

- What did I learn?

    I gained a better understanding of how to use React, some Redux, and also how to adjust everything to use Redux.
